# Chutes-and-ladders-UICode
This is a project created for class showcasing UI code.
The CPP/Header files are for respective elements/classes used to generate the game and game UI. 
The mainwindow handles the loop and game functionality, and mainwindow.ui is the UI layout file to set up the initial game UI framework. The game file contains much of the core code underlying the mainwindow tasks. The shape file handles updating/showing the user pieces (which are circular, colored pieces.)
This is a version of chutes and ladders with green representing ladders and purple representing chutes. It is a working game with win conditions and the ability to undo moves (with limited undos). It can be quit/restarted at any point without restarting the application, and the player count/names are variable based on user input. To play it, open these files in the QTCreator launcher and run the QT project file (named hw4).
